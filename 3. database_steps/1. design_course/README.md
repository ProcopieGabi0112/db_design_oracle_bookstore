# 1-Design Patter of Database

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### About The Project

This is a folder where you can find all you need to knwo about the a design schema of a database. In a case where everything could be done as per the book, the next steps should be the ones I will describe below:

## Main steps of database design

### Step 1. Entity - Relation Diagram

This diagram is made to detect which are the main tables that you will have in the database. Also in this scheme we will identify the bond between entities (tables) and the important attributes that we will find in each table.

- [x] Step 1.1. The first step is to think about the main table from which we start designing. The name of the table must be suggestive and must be a singular noun.
     - [ ] In this table, it is important to think about the main attributes that we will find in the table.
- [x] Step 1.2. After we have established the main attributes, then we have to think about which of these attributes will be repeated and it is not right from an optimization point of view to have the values ​​of these attributes as many times as possible in our main table.
     - [ ] Determine which are the attributes that will be repeated and create a separate table for them.
     - [ ] For these tables, create a list of significant attributes that we will find in the diagram.
- [x] Step 1.3. In addition to these tables, we should also think of a series of tables that we want to include in our scheme to be able to design our business model
     - [ ] In order to figure out which tables we should add, we should ask ourselves a series of business questions such as:
          - [x] What do we want to do with the main object in our database?
          - [x] When do we want to do this with our main object?
          - [x] How do we want to do this with our main object?
          - [ ] There is no problem if we add tables to the scheme along the way. We can always return to this scheme and add more elements as long as we make the changes in the next scheme as well.
- [x] Step 1.4. At this step we have tables that we will use and we want to see what are the relationships between these tables.
     - [ ] I will describe the process between two tables and the rest will be done exactly the same. If we consider the book and author table, then we can start to draw the relationships between the entities. These relationships are created based on a series of questions that we ask regarding the two tables that we have. There are 3 types of relationships that we can draw, namely One To One, One To Many and Many to Many. The sign of "One" is represented by a simple bar. The sign of "Many" is presented in many ways, but we will consider the "crow's foot" or "-<-" as the only sign that we will use at this moment. In theory, we have more type of notations. We can use "-<-" but can simply write above the bar M, M(1) or M(0) where this 1/0 represent the cardinality. In most cases, I have noticed that this notation is used to cross the middle of the bar with the verb you would use in the question you are about to ask. 
          - [x] Step 1.4.1. Can a book be written by one author (one author), several authors?
               - [ ] If a book can be written by several authors, then we will put the sign for "Many" next to the author table.
               - [ ] The thing related to the existence of a book that may not have any author gives us the cardinality. This tells us if it is possible in our model to have a book that does not have an author. In this case, we must put a bar next to the "Many" sign next to the table. If we put this bar then we have to realize that a book can have one or more authors, but not necessarily only one.
          - [x] Step 1.4.2. Can an author write a book (one book), several books? Can an author not write a book?          
               - [x] We have to ask the same questions in the opposite direction to be able to make the connection between the author table and the book.
          - [ ] After we have finished with these two tables, we must do the same for all the tables we have in the diagram depending on the connection we want to have between the entities.       
- [x] Step 1.5. At this step, we have to determine which are the primary keys for all the tables that we find in our scheme.
     - [x] The primary key represents the attribute that gives uniqueness to each record in our table. By uniqueness I mean the fact that this key cannot be NULL or be found on several records with the same value.
     - [x] After finishing this step, we can move on to the next scheme.

### Step 2. Conceptual Schema

In this diagram we will transform the relationships we have just defined in the scheme. Depending on the relationships that we will transform, we will also introduce foreign keys into the tables.

- [x] Step 2.1. The first thing we have to do is identify the 3 types of relationships we have from the previous diagram.
     - [ ] One To One
     - [ ] One To Many
     - [ ] Many To Many
- [x] Step 2.2. After we have identified the examples of relationships from each type, we should transform them. The main transformation consists in changing the "crow's foot" into an "X" next to the table where it is necessary and for the rest depending on the situation we will have to follow the situations below.
     - [x] One To One Relations
          - [ ] In the case of this relationship, we will do as follows. We need to add a foreign key to one of the tables. In this situation, the choice remains with us depending on what suits us more. In some situations, we can put it on the table with less columns.
          - [ ] After choosing which table to put the foreign key in, then we will add the column to the table.
          - [ ] After that we will change the "crow's foot" with an "X" ​​next to the table where we put the foreign key.
     - [x] One To Many Relations
          - [ ] In the case of this relationship, we will do as follows. We have to put the foreing key in the table that have the "crow's foot". 
          - [ ] After we put the foreign key column in table then we will have to change the "crow's foot" with an "X" ​​next to the table where we put the foreign key.   
     - [x] Many to Many Relations
          - [ ] In the case of this relationship, we will do as follows.We will have to create a table that we will call "associative table".
          - [ ] In this table we will include the primary keys of the two tables we linked. We will have to put one to many relations between the main tables and this associative table. I will also have to put a cross next to the "X" attached to the associative table.
          - [ ] This sign "X" no longer signifies cardinality, but represents the fact that the primary keys added to the associative table will also have to be foreign keys.
          - [ ] In this associative table you can also enter other attributes that may be significant for the moment when a record is created linked to the two tables in the database.
- [x] Step 2.3. After we have achieved this, we can move on to the next scheme.

### Step 3. The logical design of the database

In this diagram we will start from the relationship entity diagram. This diagram is similar to the conceptual diagram, only that it uses certain elements from the entity-relationship diagram.

- [x] Step 3.1. The first thing we have to do is identify the 3 types of relationships we have from the entity relation diagram.
     - [ ] One To One
     - [ ] One To Many
     - [ ] Many To Many
- [x] Step 3.2. After we have identified the examples of relationships from each type, we should transform them exactly as above. The main transformation consists in changing the "crow's foot" into an "->" next to the table where it is necessary and for the rest depending on the situation we will have to follow the situations below. If we have a foreign key then we put the "empty arrow" in the right where we have the foreign key. If the foreign key is also a primary key, then we will put the "filled arrow".
     - [x] We do not put foreign keys in their tables. We just put the arrows to the tables we need. Until this step in the tables we pass only the primary keys.
     - [x] We make the transformations we made earlier. At "One To One" we modify with the "empty arrow". At "One To Many", we put the arrow towards "Many" table. And with "Many To Many", we make the table and the primary keys and make the arrows next to the associative table to be filled. 
     - [x] I have described the different notations regarding the writing of the verb above the bar and the notation with M, M(0) or M(1) in the relationship entity diagram. In this case, I see that this notation was preserved with M(1) and the writing of the verb above the line.
     - [x] I have described the different notations regarding the writing of the verb above the bar and the notation with M, M(0) or M(1) in the relationship entity diagram. In this case, I see that this notation was preserved with M(1) and the writing of the verb above the line.
     - [ ] We will underline the primary key to figure out which of the columns it is.     
- [x] Step 3.3. At this step we check if we have singular attributes. To understand better, we will think about an attribute called "address". This "address" attribute will contain several elements that we will "break" into several columns. If certain columns of these will have values ​​that can be repeated excessively then we will consider the idea of ​​making another table where we will add these values ​​and we will add in our main table a foreign key to the primary key of this newly created table.
- [x] Step 3.4. Also here we have to make sure that our model is in all the normal forms that we will describe below.
     - [x] The first normal form
          - [x] A relationship is in the first normal form if each attribute that composes it corresponds to an indivisible (atomic) value. To understand better we can consider the example with the "address" column mentioned earlier. It is not right to leave in a table the primary key and a very long column with a lot of information in it. This information must be separated and placed on a different record that must be linked to the same primary key or make several columns.
     - [x] The second normal form
          - [x] A relation is in second normal form if and only if: a) the relation is in FN1 and b) every attribute that is not a key (does not participate in the primary key) is dependent on the entire primary key. We will consider an example below to understand better. Example of  that is not in Second Normal Form (2NF). Let’s consider a table called "Order" that is not in Second Normal Form (2NF). This table contains information about orders, products, and customers

| #OrderID  | #ProductID | ProductName | CustomerID | CustomerName  | Quantity | UnitPrice  |
|-----------|------------|-------------|------------|---------------|----------|------------|
| 1         | 101        | Laptop      | 201        | John Smith    |  2       | 3000       |
| 1         | 102        | Mouse       | 201        | John Smith    |  1       | 100        |     
| 2         | 103        | Keyboard    | 202        | Mary Johnson  |  2       | 200        |

The table does not comply with Second Normal Form (2NF) because the primary key is compose from 2 attributes (OrderID, ProductID).
Attributes `ProductName` and `UnitPrice` depend only on ``#ProductID``, and `CustomerName` depends only on ``#CustomerID``, not on the entire primary key (OrderID + ProductID).
The solution to solve this problem can be seen below

### 1. Identify functional dependencies:
   `ProductName` and `UnitPrice` depend only on `#ProductID`.
   `CustomerName` depends only on `CustomerID`.
   `Quantity` depends on the entire composite key (`OrderID`, `ProductID`).
### 2. Split the table into smaller tables.
Important in this normal form is not to agglomerate a lot of information in a table, but divide the information between several tables. We can think of the tables we could make without thinking about the existence of this normal form.

`` [1] CUSTOMER TABLE `` (customer details)

| CustomerID | CustomerName | 
|------------|--------------|
| 201        | John Smith   |
| 202        | Mary Johnson | 

`` [2] PRODUCT TABLE `` (product details)

| ProductID  |	ProductName  |	UnitPrice | 
|------------|--------------|-----------|
| 101        | Laptop       |  3000     |
| 102        | Mouse        |  100      |         
| 103        | Keyboard     |  200      |

`` [3] ORDER TABLE `` (general order information)

| OrderID   | CustomerID | 
|-----------|------------|
| 1         | 201        |
| 1         | 202        |      

`` [4] ORDER - PRODUCT TABLE `` (relationship between orders and products)

| OrderID    |	ProductID    |	Quantity  | 
|------------|--------------|-----------|
| 1          | 101          |  2        |
| 1          | 102          |  1        |         
| 2          | 103          |  1        |

- [x] The third normal form
     - [x] A relation is in third normal form if and only if the relation is in FN2 and if every attribute that is not a key (does not participate in a key) depends on the key, on the whole key and only on the key. We will also use an example to highlight what the third normal form means. We will consider the ``SALES`` table

`` SALES TABLE `` (relationship between orders and products)

| #Item      |	Supplier     |	Phone Supplier   | Price   |
|------------|--------------|------------------|---------|
| XboxOne    | Microsoft    |  (800) +07443355 | 250     |
| PS4        | Sony         |  (800) +07557799 | 300     |        
| PSVita     | Sony         |  (800) +07557799 | 200     |

These 2 columns ``Supplier`` and ``Phone Supplier`` are dependent and this dependency could be optimized as follows.

`` ITEM TABLE `` (general informations about items)

| #Item      |	Supplier(FK) |	 Price   |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| XboxOne    | Microsoft    |  250     |
| PS4        | Sony         |  300     |        
| PSVita     | Sony         |  200     |

`` SUPPLIER TABLE `` (general information about suppliers)

|	Supplier  |  Phone Supplier  |   
|--------------|------------------|
| Microsoft    |  (800) +07443355 |
| Sony         |  (800) +07557799 |       

- [x] The Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)
     - [x]  A relation is in BCNF if and only if the relation is in FN3 and each determinant is a supercandidate key. The determinant is an attribute or a set of redundant attributes, which constitutes a unique identifier for another attribute or set of attributes of a given relationship. A supercandidate key is a set of one or more attributes in a database table that can uniquely identify each row in the table.

`` TEACHER TABLE `` (information about teachers)

| teacher    |	discipline   |	room  | 
|------------|--------------|-------|
| Popescu    | Matematică   | 101   |
| Ionescu    | Fizică       | 102   |        
| Popescu    | Fizică       | 101   |

The problem is the following. The teacher depends on the room. A room is intended for a single dsicipline.
These dependencies create a problem because the room indirectly determines the teacher, and Teacher is not a supercandidate key.
The solution to this problem is to divide the table into two tables.

`` TEACHERS ROOMS TABLE `` (information about the room of the teachers)

| teacher    |	room  | 
|------------|-------|
| Popescu    | 101   |
| Ionescu    | 102   |        

`` ROOM DISCIPLINE TABLE `` (information about the discipline of the rooms)

| room   | discipline  | 
|--------|-------------|
| 101    | Matematică  |
| 102    | Fizică      |       

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

- [x] The fourth normal form
     - [x] A relation is in fourth normal form if and only if the relation is in BCNF and if and contains no multivalued dependencies. Multivalued dependencies is the situation in which the value of one attribute (or many attributes) determines many values ​​of another attribute (or many attributes).

`` AUTHOR TABLE `` (information about the authors)

| author_id  |	language   |  genre  |
|------------|------------|---------|
| 1          | english    |  poetry |
| 1          | french     |  poetry |         
| 1          | english    |  novel  | 
| 1          | french     |  novel  |

The problem is related to the fact that there is a multivalued dependency between ``language`` and ``genre`` for the same author. These two pieces of information are not related to each other, which introduces redundancy.

`` AUTHOR LANGUAGE TABLE `` (general informations about language of authors)

| author_id  |	language |
|------------|----------|
| 1          | english  |
| 1          | french   | 

`` AUTHOR GENRE TABLE `` (general information about genre of authors)

| author_id  |	genre  |
|------------|--------|
| 1          | poetry |
| 1          | novel  | 

- [x] The fifth normal form
     - [x] A relation is in fifth normal form if and only if the relation is in FN4 and if all dependencies are projection-union dependencies (that is, any information lost by splitting the tables can only be reconstructed by joining them).

`` PROJECTS TABLE `` (information about the projects)

| project_id | employee_id |  role       |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1          | 101         | programmer  |
| 1          | 102         | tester      |         
| 2          | 101         | programmer  | 
| 2          | 103         | manager     |

The problem is related to the fact that the complex relationship between projects, employees and roles can lead to redundancy. We need to see if we can split this table without loss. 
The solution would be to split the table into three projections to be able to reconstruct the original table by joining these tables.

`` PROJECT EMPLOYEE TABLE `` (relation between project and employee that work on)

| project_id  | employee_id |
|-------------|-------------|
| 1           | 101         |
| 1           | 102         | 
| 2           | 101         |
| 2           | 103         |

`` ROLE PROJECT TABLE `` (general information  role of the person who work on the projects)

| project_id  | role        |
|-------------|-------------|
| 1           | programmer  |
| 1           | tester      |
| 2           | programmer  |
| 2           | manager     |

`` ROLE OF EMPLOYEE TABLE `` (general information about the role of the employees)

| employee_id  |  role      |
|--------------|------------|
| 101          | programmer |
| 102          | tester     | 
| 103          | manager    |

- [x] The sixth normal form
     - [x] A relation is in sixth normal form if and only if the relation can handle changes over time and to preserve fine granularity of data.

`` EMPLOYEE TABLE `` (information about the employees)

| employee_id  |  salary  | start_date  | end_date   |
|--------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1            |  3000    | 2025-06-30  |            |   
| 1            |  3500    | NULL        |            |

Above you can see a table in which the salary changes of an employee are stored over a period. 
For this table to be in FN6, then we will have to separate each attribute that can vary over time into separate tables.
The first step would be to identify the attributes that can vary over time. Attributes like ``salary``, ``start_date``, and ``end_date`` are time-dependent and can change for the same employee_id. Each of these attributes will be split into separate tables. The second step would be to create individual tables for each time-varying attribute

`` SALARY TABLE `` (stores changes in salary over time)

| employee_id  |  salary  | effective_date   |
|--------------|----------|------------------|
| 1            |  3000    | 2025-06-30       |            
| 1            |  3500    | NULL             |           

`` START_TIME TABLE `` (tracks the start date of changes or new roles.)

| employee_id  | start_date       |
|--------------|------------------|
| 1            | 2025-06-30       |            
           
`` END_TIME TABLE `` (tracks the start date of changes or new roles.)

| employee_id  | end_date  |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1            | NULL      |      

#### Conclusions

| Form | Practical advice |
|------|------------------|
| FN1  | Do not keep too much information in one column          |
| FN2  | If you create a table with a multiple primary key, see if there is a better option to break the table in two. There is a chance that not all attributes depend on the entire composed key |
| FN3  | If there is a possibility to remove an attribute outside a table by foreign key, then do not hesitate to do so.           | 
| BCNF | If the information in a table does not seem clear to you, then break the table into several tables and see if you get roughly the same thing.           |
| FN4  | Generalization FN3. Do not try to keep very large values ​​in a single column of a table.           |
| FN5  | Generalization FN3. Do not try to keep a lot of columns in a table. It's better to keep the columns separate so you don't end up not realizing what you have there.         |
| FN6  | The more complicated the business logic is, the more complicated it is to figure out what you want to do basically. Keep things simple.          |


### Step 4. The physical design of the database

In this diagram we will insert everything we need to be able to create the database.

- [x] Step 4.1. At this step we will add the tables that we will have in the database
     - [ ] table name
     - [ ] data types of attributes
     - [ ] comments of columns
     - [ ] contraints (pk, fk and other constrainnts)
     - [ ] other stuff that help you to build yor database
- [x] Step 4.2. At this step we will add the relations between tables.
     - [ ] We can only add the lines with the "x" sign next to the table where we find foreign keys.
- [x] Step 4.3. We can also add ideas about types of triggers or other types of things that we can do later in the data processing stage.
     - [ ] Indecsi
     - [ ] Triggeri
     - [ ] Partitioning
