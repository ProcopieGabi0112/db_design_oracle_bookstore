# 1-Database-Design-Patterns

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### About The Project

This is a repository project that we can find all database design you need. Maybe sometime in your life you need a database template of a business and you dont know where to start. From now you can come here and download your template from here. I think this is it your solution. Use the `README.md` to get started.

### Built With
As a person who has been working in the IT field since a young age, I believe that there is a limited number of types of database management systems that you should study to be able to say that you can handle any other existing database management system.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Above you can select the type of database system. By accessing the respective folder, you will find other folders with specific names that will guide you to the desired example.

## Installation

After choosing the type of system you will find a folder called ``install_pref_vers`` where you will find steps for installing each version of the database system you are looking for.
If you want to add other versions, don't hesitate to contact me.
